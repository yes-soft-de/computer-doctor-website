                        Virus Removal
                        Common PC problems are those relating to viruses, Trojans, spyware, adware and other types of malware. No PC is immune to viruses and malware, even with the best antivirus protection!
                        Most viruses these days are in the guise of popups, fake programs and scans designed to get your money and credit card details. Others are more serious and can take over your computer completely. New and potentially devastating viruses can encrypt all of your data on your hard drive and wipe all of your documents if you do not pay a ransom fee – this can also affect any backup drives you have connected at the time. Thankfully there are solutions available that can minimise these risks.
                        Always seek professional advice when your computer is infected with a virus to ensure that it is fully and correctly removed.

                    <p>
                    Computers should have regular check-ups every 6 to 18 months to ensure that everything is running properly. Over time a lot of junk and clutter on your computer can really start to slow things down. And if you install or remove programs regularly, or notice that the computer is running slower than usual, it may be time for a check-up. The technicians will visit to make your computer run as efficiently as possible.                </p>
